<h1>Tak-1 : TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION:</h1>

Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is
a classic beginner project with readily available data.

The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age,
gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

<h1>Tak-2 : CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION:</h1>

Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card Transactions. Pre-process and normalize
the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train
a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent
or genuine.

Evaluate the model' s performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques
like oversampling or under sampling for improving results.
